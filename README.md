My solutions for puzzles from AoC 2021.

Each file should be run from the repository root:

    python dayXX/partX.py

Some `partX.py` files include tests compatible with pytest. Because of
the naming, the tests won't be automatically detected by simply running
`pytest` in the repository root. Instead you should point pytest to a
given file:

    pytest dayXX/partX.py
